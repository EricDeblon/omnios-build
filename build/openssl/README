The openssl package contains both OpenSSL 1.0.x and 1.1.x versions.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 will not reach end-of-life until the end of 2019 but the
journey starts now.

The libraries for both are always present in /lib and /usr/lib so software
linked against a specific version will work but the other components such as
binaries, header file and man pages are switched in and out using an IPS
mediator. The default version is 1.1 and version 1.0 must be manually selected
if required.

* To build software against a specific version regardless of the mediator
  setting, the /usr/ssl-1.0 and /usr/ssl-1.1 directories provide
  version-specific include files and libraries. It is usually enough to set
  CFLAGS="-I/usr/ssl-1.x/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/ssl-1.x/include"
* OmniOS itself now builds mostly against v1.1 and a check has been added to
  the build process to ensure the correct mediator is selected.
* There are currently a handful of OmniOS userland packages which
  do not build with openssl 1.1. The list of those packages is being
  maintained in this file and will be updated as upstream packages are
  migrated to v1.
* OmniOS OpenSSL v1.1 does not currently include the pkcs11 engine from
  Oracle (whereas v1.0 does). If this engine is required going forwards
  (and there seems to be some doubt that anyone cares) then it will need
  to be integrated later.

To switch mediator:

bloody% pkg mediator -a openssl
