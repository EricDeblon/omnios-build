mpatch: be more careful about parsing binary patch data (SEC)

It appears to have been possible to trivially walk off the end of an
allocated region with a malformed patch. Oops.

Caught when writing an mpatch fuzzer for oss-fuzz.

This defect is OVE-20180430-0001. A CVE has not been obtained as of
this writing.
