These is the precise version of gcc recommended by Illumos for building
the kernel.  It is only required (and useful) for building the kernel.
It is distributed in binary form, because it is painful to build and
if you need to rebuild it, you likely need to revalidate the kernel on
the newly built version and that version should be something more recent
like 4.6.
